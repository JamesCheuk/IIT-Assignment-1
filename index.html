			<h1>Personal Info</h1>
			<p> I am of Chinese descent, born in Hong Kong and migrated to Australia when I was 4 years old. 
			I am also able to speak Cantonese fluently and also comfortable speaking in Mandarin too on a conversational level. 
			I completed my HSC in 2009 and moved onto a Bachelor of Aviation during my first stint in university. 
			I have done flying as part of that degree with the most memorable flight being a solo flight from Sydney Bankstown to Archerfield airport in Brisbane. 
			During my free time I usually find myself spending time playing games, either an adventure role playing game or a strategy game.

			<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
			<p> My interest in IT started with all the games I have played in my free time, which has culminated to a desire to create games one day. 
			As such the specific part of IT I am interested in is the programming and game design. 
			I am aware that game design requires more than just programming, it will also require knowledge of various game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine and creating 2D and 3D models.
			I came to study at RMIT because it has a good reputation when it comes to teaching Information Technology courses and it offers online learning during these trying times. 
			Through studying with RMIT, I hope to gain a better understanding of the IT industry, its far-reaching impact and the future possibilities that IT has to offer. 
			And with this knowledge I hope to be able to place myself in a position where I can fulfill the wish of working in the IT industry.

			<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
			<h2>Mid-to-Senior Unity Developer</h2>
			<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50467208?type=standard#searchRequestToken=024f0607-d69b-4462-85a1-5979e626d2cb" target="_blank">
			Link to the job advertisement</a>
			<p> This advertisement is for the position of a Unity game developer with Chaos Theory Games. They are a fairly small studio that focuses on developing games that are more than just for entertainment. 
			They aim to create games that can be used for other purposes such as learning and to inspire people to achieve greater things. 
			This is appeals to me because as someone who thoroughly enjoys gaming, the chance to bring the joy of gaming to others who don’t usually game is an exciting opportunity.
			The skills required for the role include team work and problem solving, which is standard across all IT roles and something that I have plenty of experience in through high school assignments, university assignments and work experience. 
			The qualifications and experience this role require is mastery of the C# programming language, a thorough understanding of Unity and animation systems and work experience on a shipped mobile game made with Unity. 
			These are things that I currently do not have, all I have is some very basic experience with C# when I worked overseas.
			In order to fulfill the requirements of this job advertisement, I plan to undertake further learning, with a university or not, to learn about the C# programming language, how to use Unity and create animations. 
			Once I am close to completing these learning objectives it would be ideal to join a larger game developer and be part of a team that will ship out games.

			<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
			<h2>Personality Test</h2>
			<img src="personality-quiz-result.JPG" alt="Myers-Brigg personality result" width="350" height="750" >
			<p> Based on the results of the above test that I have taken; it would seem that I am someone who places more value on logical thought processes and procedures than an emotional or spontaneous approach to problem solving. 
			It also suggests that I am someone who spends a lot of time in their own head, trying to find logical solutions and explanations for various problems I would encounter, resulting in less time for seemingly unimportant things such as social gatherings or understanding emotions. 
			As a result of this, I could potentially come across as someone who is cold, hard to approach and perhaps even stubborn.
			In a team, these perceptions would be a hinderance to the success of the team, team members may be afraid to initiate a discussion with me about problems that have occurred, resulting in a break down in communications and potentially sabotaging the group project. 
			I may also come across as stubborn and arrogant, having reached what I believe to be a logical solution to a problem and refusing to accept other ideas that are deemed irrational.
			In order to ensure that the group is able to function and produce the best work, I need to ensure that I take into account the emotions of other people in the group, spend some time to understand how others came to a conclusion and use it as an opportunity to learn more about the emotional side that my personality doesn’t pay enough attention to.
			</p>
			<h2>Learning Style</h2>
			<img src="learning-style-result.JPG" alt="Honey and Mumford learning styles result" >
			<p> Based on the result of the above test, my primary style of learning is a cautious, back seat contemplative approach, one where they take plenty of time to collect and analyse information to reach a conclusion. 
			This is supplemented by a logical, rational and disciplined approach with the need to be shown how to put what they’ve learnt into practice. As you can see however, there is a lack of actually taking action to personally using what I’ve been taught and demonstrated.
			In a group project, everyone is learning and making progress in their own ways. Some might have more concrete evidence of this progress, while my learning style may result in less concrete evidence. 
			This might come across as being lazy, and “getting carried”.
			To compensate for this so it doesn’t become a problem, I will need to ensure that I at least write down any ideas and conclusions I reach so that I have something I can share with my team members.	
			</p>
			<h2>Leadership Style</h2>
			<img src="usc-leadership-quiz-result.JPG" alt="USC Leadership quiz result" >
			<p> The media (movies, television shows) portrays as the ideal leader as a person who is front and centre of everything, who makes all the decisions when they need to be made while leading the group. A contrarian leader is the opposite of that. 
			A contrarian leader is not afraid of delegating the decision making to someone else and are willing to hold off on making a decision that can be reasonably put off to another day. 
			Regarding the first point, it may come across as being afraid to lead and take responsibility in a team. However, delegating the decision making does not mean delegating the responsibility too. 
			A contrarian leader will assume responsibility for the decisions they delegate to others. This is an advantage as it allows other team members to showcase their qualities without fear, resulting in a higher quality of work and a more cohesive unit.
			The second point is a double-edged sword, as grasping the correct timing is more art than science. An advantage of waiting is that unforeseen options may open up for you, while at the same time waiting too long can result in options being lost. 
			In a team environment, this particular trait may come in handy when dealing with conflict, as the extra time may allow the group to calm down and find a better solution to the conflict before making the final decision.

			<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			<h2>Location Triggered Alarm 'Never Miss a Stop'</h2>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p> This project will aim to create a mobile application which has a location triggered alarm. 
			The user will be able to choose a location from a map and set how far away from the target location the alarm will go off. 
			It will also contain features that will save the users’ alarms, allow certain customisation options for the alarms, offer online or offline option and operate in the background like regular stock alarms that come with all mobile devices.
			</p>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p> This would be an application that is targeted towards users who frequently travel on public transportation. 
			With the busy and fast paced lifestyle of our everyday lives, moments on public transportation becomes a great time to catch up on some sleep. 
			As a result of catching up on some sleep, we may inadvertently miss our stop and thus waste valuable time and this can cause anxiety and stress that would impact the quality of sleep. 
			This application aims to put these anxieties aside so the user can sleep knowing this application will wake them up when they are nearing their destination.
			</p>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p> This application in the simplest terms is an alarm with location tracking capabilities. The application will require access to the device’s time and date, GPS services and limited internet access. 
			In order to minimise data usage, a map of the city of the user’s choosing will be installed when the application is opened for the first time, which will allow offline usage. <br>
			The application will open to a home screen, which will be a map with the user’s current location displayed. At the top of the screen will be: <br>
				•	A search bar where the user can find their destination and when they press search, they will be directed to the search result screen <br>
				•	On the left side will be a menu that can be accessed by swiping the left edge of the screen that will have buttons for viewing existing saved alarms, updating the installed map and settings <br>
			The search result screen will have a display in the top half of the screen showing the destination, and the bottom half of the screen will have, with scrolling function: <br>
				•	A drop box for the user to select how far away from the destination for the alarm to start going off (from 300m to 1km) <br>
				•	A text box to give the alarm a name <br>
				•	An option to select a ring tone from existing music files (it will default to the user’s current ring tone) <br>
				•	A checkbox for whether it should be on repeat. If checked, new options will appear allowing the user to select which day(s) to repeat on and after what time to become active <br>
				•	Two buttons side by side, one to save the alarm, one to cancel and return to the previous screen <br>
			The saved alarms screen will be where the user will be able to view all their saved alarms, with each save file displaying its name, destination, distance to destination to ring, whether it repeats and the option to turn the alarm on/off. 
			The user will also be able to make modifications to existing saved alarms by tapping the save file which will lead the user to the search result screen to make the changes and save them. 
			This screen will also offer the user the choice to delete any saved alarm by dragging it to a disposal area at the bottom of the screen. <br>
			The update maps button from the side menu will connect the device to a server that holds all the maps available to the users. A comparison will be made of the map version on the device against the version available on the server, if the versions do not match the user will be given a prompt to update the existing map. 
			Prior to updating the map, if the device is not connected to Wi-Fi the user will be given a warning regarding excessive data usage. <br>
			The settings page will be where the user can choose their tracking method (GPS, network or both), view application version, patch notes and contact the developer should any issue arise while they are using the application. <br>
			</p>
			<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
			<p> The tools and technologies that would be required to create this application include the Java programming language, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) most likely to be Eclipse, a map database and a server to host the map database. <br>
			Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means the software is organised around data instead of functions and logic. This allows the developer to focus on what data they would need and how these data would interact with each other to produce the desired result. 
			This would all be done on the Eclipse IDE which offers the developer various tools they would need to develop the application such as code editor, compiler and debugger. <br>
			The map database that the application will use will be limited to a select few large cities around the world where there is an extensive public transportation network available.
			</p>
			<h3>Skills Required</h3>
			<p> The skills that would be required for this project is outstanding knowledge of the Java programming language and how to use it to achieve your goals and being familiar with the Eclipse IDE so that development on it can progress smoothly. 
			Some knowledge on how to set up and maintain a server would also be ideal, probably SQL (Structured Query Language). <br>
			Acquiring the skills listed above would not be difficult to achieve, as Java and SQL are very common and there are plenty of people who would be familiar with both. 
			Learning both would also not pose a problem as there are many resources available that will teach someone how to use Java and SQL. As for the server, there are places where you can hire a server that suits your needs (e.g. hire-intelligence). 
			The biggest problem may be finding the map database to be used alongside the application.
			</p>
			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p> Assuming the project is successful, it will allow regular public transportation users to rest on their journey without having to worry about oversleeping and missing their stop. 
			If this application gets enough following, it would be possible that the stock alarms that come with most mobile devices will look to incorporate a location trigger function and become the new standard, and this project will be the spark that brings about this change.
