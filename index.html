			<h1>Personal Info</h1>
			<p> I am of Chinese descent, born in Hong Kong and migrated to Australia when I was 4 years old. 
			I primarily speak Cantonese at home, English everywhere and am comfortable speaking in Mandarin too on a conversational level. 
			I completed my HSC in 2009 and moved onto a Bachelor of Aviation during my first stint in university. 
			I have done some flying as part of that degree with the most memorable flight being a solo flight from Sydney Bankstown to Archerfield airport in Brisbane. 
			During my free time I usually find myself spending time in some games, either an adventure role playing game or a strategy game.

			<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
			<p> My interest in IT started with all the games I have played in my free time, which has culminated to a desire to create games one day. 
			As such the specific part of IT I am interested in is the programming and game design. 
			I am aware that game design requires more than just programming, it will also require knowledge of various game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine and creating 2D and 3D models.
			I came to study at RMIT because it has a good reputation when it comes to teaching Information Technology courses and it offers online learning during these trying times. 
			Through studying with RMIT, I hope to gain a better understanding of the IT industry, its far-reaching impact and the future possibilities that IT has to offer. 
			And with this knowledge I hope to be able to place myself in a position where I can fulfill the wish of working in the IT industry.

			<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
			<h2>Mid-to-Senior Unity Developer</h2>
			<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50467208?type=standard#searchRequestToken=024f0607-d69b-4462-85a1-5979e626d2cb" target="_blank">
			Link to the job advertisement</a>
			<p> This advertisement is for the position of a Unity game developer with Chaos Theory Games. They are a fairly small studio that focuses on developing games that are more than just for entertainment. 
			They aim to create games that can be used for other purposes such as learning and to inspire people to achieve greater things. 
			This is appeals to me because as someone who thoroughly enjoys gaming, the chance to bring the joy of gaming to others who don’t usually game is an exciting opportunity.
			The skills required for the role include team work and problem solving, which is standard across all IT roles and something that I have plenty of experience in through high school assignments, university assignments and work experience. 
			The qualifications and experience this role require is mastery of the C# programming language, a thorough understanding of Unity and animation systems and work experience on a shipped mobile game made with Unity. 
			These are things that I currently do not have, all I have is some very basic experience with C# when I worked overseas.
			In order to fulfill the requirements of this job advertisement, I plan to undertake further learning, with a university or not, to learn about the C# programming language, how to use Unity and create animations. 
			Once I am close to completing these learning objectives it would be ideal to join a larger game developer and be part of a team that will ship out games.

			<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
			<h2>Personality Test</h2>
			<img src="personality-quiz-result.JPG" alt="Myers-Brigg personality result" width="350" height="750" >
			<p> Based on the results of the above test that I have taken; it would seem that I am someone who places more value on logical thought processes and procedures than an emotional or spontaneous approach to problem solving. 
			It also suggests that I am someone who spends a lot of time in their own head, trying to find logical solutions and explanations for various problems I would encounter, resulting in less time for seemingly unimportant things such as social gatherings or understanding emotions. 
			As a result of this, I could potentially come across as someone who is cold, hard to approach and perhaps even stubborn.
			In a team, these perceptions would be a hinderance to the success of the team, team members may be afraid to initiate a discussion with me about problems that have occurred, resulting in a break down in communications and potentially sabotaging the group project. 
			I may also come across as stubborn and arrogant, having reached what I believe to be a logical solution to a problem and refusing to accept other ideas that are deemed irrational.
			In order to ensure that the group is able to function and produce the best work, I need to ensure that I take into account the emotions of other people in the group, spend some time to understand how others came to a conclusion and use it as an opportunity to learn more about the emotional side that my personality doesn’t pay enough attention to.
			</p>
			<h2>Learning Style</h2>
			<img src="learning-style-result.JPG" alt="Honey and Mumford learning styles result" >
			<p> Based on the result of the above test, my primary style of learning is a cautious, back seat contemplative approach, one where they take plenty of time to collect and analyse information to reach a conclusion. 
			This is supplemented by a logical, rational and disciplined approach with the need to be shown how to put what they’ve learnt into practice. As you can see however, there is a lack of actually taking action to personally using what I’ve been taught and demonstrated.
			In a group project, everyone is learning and making progress in their own ways. Some might have more concrete evidence of this progress, while my learning style may result in less concrete evidence. 
			This might come across as being lazy, and “getting carried”.
			To compensate for this so it doesn’t become a problem, I will need to ensure that I at least write down any ideas and conclusions I reach so that I have something I can share with my team members.	
			</p>
			<h2>Leadership Style</h2>
			<img src="usc-leadership-quiz-result.JPG" alt="USC Leadership quiz result" >
			<p> The media (movies, television shows) portrays as the ideal leader as a person who is front and centre of everything, who makes all the decisions when they need to be made while leading the group. A contrarian leader is the opposite of that. 
			A contrarian leader is not afraid of delegating the decision making to someone else and are willing to hold off on making a decision that can be reasonably put off to another day. 
			Regarding the first point, it may come across as being afraid to lead and take responsibility in a team. However, delegating the decision making does not mean delegating the responsibility too. 
			A contrarian leader will assume responsibility for the decisions they delegate to others. This is an advantage as it allows other team members to showcase their qualities without fear, resulting in a higher quality of work and a more cohesive unit.
			The second point is a double-edged sword, as grasping the correct timing is more art than science. An advantage of waiting is that unforeseen options may open up for you, while at the same time waiting too long can result in options being lost. 
			In a team environment, this particular trait may come in handy when dealing with conflict, as the extra time may allow the group to calm down and find a better solution to the conflict before making the final decision.
